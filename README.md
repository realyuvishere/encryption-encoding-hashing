# Encryption, Encoding, Hashing and Obfuscation

This repository simply explains the above concepts. This repository mostly goes in conjunction with the [blog post](https://yuvishere.co.in/blog/encryption-encoding-hashing-obfuscation---understanding-how-security-works-in-applications/ "Read this for more context") about the same.

### How to use this repository

Since it uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), it's a pre-requisite. The following are the package scripts:

- `start`: It launches the main program which outputs the source code along with the output for each of the files with the `.example.js` extension in the directory.
- `start:obfuscation`, `start:encryption`, `start:encoding`, `start:hashing` are the scripts to launch the individual examples from their respective `.example.js`.
